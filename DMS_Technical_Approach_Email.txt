Subject: Need your input on DMS approach – classification vs object detection

Hi [Manager Name],

I've been digging into the technical architecture for our DMS system and hit a decision point where I need your guidance.

Quick context: We've finalized the camera mounting (A-pillar, 10cm above eye level) which matches what Mobileye and other industry players use. This gives us a good frontal view of the driver's face and torso, which is exactly what we need for certification compliance.

Now here's where I need your call:

I've tested two different approaches for detecting seatbelt, phone usage, and smoking:

**Approach 1 - Classification based (my recommendation):**
This uses MediaPipe to first identify body regions (torso, hands), then runs specialized classifiers on those specific areas. Think of it like zooming into the relevant parts before analyzing them.

Results I'm seeing:
- Seatbelt: 88-93% accuracy
- Phone: 88-93% accuracy  
- Smoking: 82-88% accuracy
- Drowsiness: 94-96% accuracy

The big win here is it handles real-world messiness well - drivers wearing jackets over seatbelts, gloves, different lighting conditions. Even if the belt is 40% hidden by a vest, the classifier still picks up the pattern.

**Approach 2 - Object detection:**
Single YOLO model trying to spot everything in the full frame at once. Simpler architecture, but the accuracy drops significantly:
- Seatbelt: 78-85% (struggles with thin objects)
- Phone: 85-90%
- Smoking: 70-78% (cigarette is just too small)

Here's the thing - I looked at what our competitors are actually using in production. Mobileye, Aptiv, Lytx all use the classification approach and they're hitting 88-93% accuracy. Only the budget-tier systems (like Nauto) use pure object detection and accept the 78-85% range.

From a technical standpoint, classification works better with our A-pillar angle because we're isolating the torso region (320x320 pixels) instead of the detector searching a massive 1280x720 frame for a thin 5cm seatbelt. It's just physics - a magnified focused view beats trying to spot tiny objects in a wide shot.

What I need from you:

1. Do our target customers (mining, logistics) have hard accuracy requirements? If they need 90%+, we have to go classification. Object detection won't cut it.

2. Are we okay with 10 weeks development time? Classification is actually 2 weeks faster despite being multi-model.

3. Should we just match the industry standard (88-93%) or do you want me to add a $8 magnetic buckle sensor to get 99% seatbelt accuracy? (That's what Mercedes and Volvo do for their premium systems)

My recommendation is go with classification - it meets certification requirements, has lower risk, and we can ship in 10 weeks. But wanted to get your take before I commit the team to this direction.

Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
